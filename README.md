# DotaTools
DotaTools is a set of python scripts that lets you output different information from the OpenDota API to separate files. It requires a config.cfg file that currently needs to be manually generated, but later on there will be a separate script to set up DotaTools for different users etc., since it is intended for automated runs on e.g. a Raspberry Pi.
